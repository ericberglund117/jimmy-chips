## About
Jimmy Chips is a golf related React app that allows players to utilize the Vegas Chip Game without the need to buy the physical chips. 
Players can add or remove chips depending on their shots throughout the round of golf. 
At the end of the round, a chip total for each player is displayed along with what each person is owed or should receive.

## Future Iterations
In upcoming iterations, I intend to incorporate the following:
- Player scoring
- Backend database to store game results and player information
- Sockets so that multiple people can interact with the application at the same time
